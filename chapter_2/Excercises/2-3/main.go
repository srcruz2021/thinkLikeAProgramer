2-3. Here’s an especially tricky one:
#            #
 ##        ##
  ###    ###
   ########

  ###    ###

/*
2-4. Design your own: Think up your own symmetrical pattern of hash marks, and see whether you can write a program to produce it that follows the shapes rule.

2-5. If you like the Luhn formula problem, try writing a program for a different check-digit system, like the 13-digit ISBN system. The program could take an identification number and verify it or take a number without its check digit and generate the check digit.

2-6. If you’ve learned about binary numbers and how to convert from decimal to binary and the reverse, try writing programs to do those conversions with unlimited length numbers (but you can assume the numbers are small enough to be stored in a standard C++ int).

2-7. Have you learned about hexadecimal? Try writing a program that lets the user specify an input in binary, decimal, or hexadecimal, and output in any of the three.

2-8. Want an extra challenge? Generalize the code for the previous exercise to make a program that converts from any number base-16 or less to any other number base. So, for example, the program could convert from base-9 to base-4.

2-9. Write a program that reads a line of text, counting the number of words, identifying the length of the longest word, the greatest number of vowels in a word, and/or any other statistics you can think of.
