/*
Design your own: Try to discover a linked-list processing problem that is difficult to solve using
iteration but can be solved directly using recursion.

A problem that is difficult to solve using iteration but simpler with recursion is reversing a linked list in place.

ðŸ”¹ Why is Iteration Difficult?
In an iterative approach, you'd need to track three pointers (prev, current, and next).

You must manually update links, which can be error-prone.

You have to loop through the entire list while adjusting pointers carefully.

ðŸ”¹ Why is Recursion Easier?
Recursion naturally unfolds the list, processing each node before assembling it in reverse.

No need for extra tracking variables like prev and next.

The function handles pointer updates automatically as it unwinds.
